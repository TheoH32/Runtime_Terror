## What is Pixel Art?
> Pixel art is an artistic design based on pixels and created using digital means. 

## How is Binary Incorporated?
> In an image created from pixel art, the pixels must be either "on" or "off" and be a certain color (if not black and white). This involves binary, since there is a boolean output (2 possible outputs, 0 or 1).

## Generating a random image using binary and pixels
- wget this [link to jupyter notebook (interactive!)](https://alexac54767.github.io/Alexa-Fastpage/2023/04/16/BinaryProjectCode.html)
- This code takes a certain amount of pixels (in this case I secified as 500 by 500) and will randomly choose between a 0 or 1 for every pixel. This use of binary will determine if the pixel is white (a 1) or black (a 0).

- This is an example of an image it produced:

- What is the *significance*?
    - Many companies/stores use this method for things like QR codes and labels. Randomly generated images of pixels allow for almost infinite possibilities for unique labels or identifications of products.

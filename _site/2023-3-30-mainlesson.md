# How is Binary Related to Boolean Expressions?

<mark>Binary and Boolean expressions</mark> are closely related because Boolean expressions are typically used to evaluate binary values, which can either be true or false (1 or 0).

Binary values are used to represent information. Boolean expressions are used to express the logical operations performed on these binary values(AND, OR, and NOT). 

|Operator|	Logical Operation|
|---|---|
|and	|Conjunction|
|or	|Disjunction|
|not	|Negation|



# Truth Tables

<mark>Truth tables</mark> represent the possible inputs and outputs of the logical operations of AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.
